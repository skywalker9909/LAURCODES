	⁃	Name: Laurel Tay
	⁃	School email: ltay3@u.rochester.edu
	⁃	Date of Submission: April 22nd
	⁃	Assignment Number: 7

	•	Self-review
	⁃	An estimate for each task (lookup, search, anagrams, normalise) would be roughly 90% with a potential bug in the main loop 
	⁃	The main method assumes that the values from the file are provided in the correct order and format, without any errors or missing values. 
	⁃	If the input is malformed, the program may produce unexpected results or throw exceptions.



	•	Metadata
	⁃	Spent about 12 hours on this assignment.
	⁃	One of the hardest parts of the assignment was likely to be coding the normalise function and learning how to effectively use a hashmap
	⁃	another challenge was figuring out how to tackle the concepts of anagrams- searching and matching the same letters
