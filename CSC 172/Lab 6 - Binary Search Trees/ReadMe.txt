Binary Search Trees
October 28th 2023

**Lab Synopsis**:
This project represents the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure for CSC172. In this lab, the main goal is to create a functional Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java, following a pair programming paradigm.

1. `BSTUnitTest.java`: This Java class contains a set of unit tests to verify the functionality of the BST implementation. It tests various operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and size.

2. `ConcreteBST.java`: This Java class represents the concrete implementation of a Binary Search Tree, including methods for inserting, deleting, and searching for elements in the tree.

3. `UR_BST.java`: The abstract class provides the foundational structure and methods for the Binary Search Tree. Concrete implementations are expected to extend this class.

**Test Cases**:
The `BSTUnitTest.java` file includes various test cases that have been run to verify the correctness of the BST implementation. These test cases include checking for basic functionality such as inserting and deleting elements, verifying the size of the tree, and traversing the tree in various orders (level-order and in-order).
